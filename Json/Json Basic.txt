JSON
(Javascript Object Notation)
- Data Representation Format (very similar to xml or yaml)
- Commonly used for APIs and Configs
- Lightweight and Easy to Read/Write
- Integrates easily with most languages

JSON Types
1. Strings - “Hello World”, “Kyle”, “I”
2. Numbers - 10,  1.5,  -30, 1.2e10
3. Booleans - true, false
4. null - null (nothing)
5. Array - [1,2,3], [“Hello”, “World”]
6. Objects - {“key”: “value”}, {“age”:30}

How to use Json in a file
- Create a file filename.json

- Array and Objects mostly used

- To create and objects
{
	“key”: ”value”,
	“key”: “value”
}
- Must be in double quotes, if multiple separate with a comma
- Don’t put a comma in the very last property

Example:
{
	“name”: “Kyle”,
	“favoriteNumber”: 3,
	“isProgrammer”: true,
	“hobbies”: [“Weight Lifting”, “Bowling”],
	“friends”: [{
		“name”: “Joey”,
		“favoriteNumber”: 100,
		“isProgrammer”: false,
	 “friends” : […]
}]
}

Example 2:
Array of different Objects of companies
[
    {
        "name": "Big Corporation",
        "numberofEmployees": 10000,
        "ceo": "Mary",
        "rating": 3.6
    },
    {
        "name":"Small Startup",
        "numberofEmployees": 3,
        "ceo": null,
        "rating": 4.3
    }
]

when dealing with json to get as string ` ` (this is usually)
To getback as Object we parse - JSON.parse(companies)
