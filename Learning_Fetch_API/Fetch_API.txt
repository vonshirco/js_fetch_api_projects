Using a fetch API builtin the browser inorder to make 
asynchronous request to different network resources by Using
get, post, put etc

How it works, (pass 2 properties)
fetch("https://reqres.in/api/users", {
    //Here you pass options eg. post, get, put, delete etc
})

It a promise
you can use .fetch or .then

Remember to include header and also stringify the JSON
